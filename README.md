# Install

Installation is straight forward, simply run the following command.

```bash
npm install -g fly-commit
```

or, if you are using npm version 5.2 or higher, you can run this cli directly without installing it globally.

```bash
npx fly-commit
```

![usage](./other/images/usage.png)

# Usage

Simply use `fly-commit` or just `commit` instead of git commit when committing. You can also use `fc`, which is an alias for `fly-commit`.

When you commit with `fly-commit`, you'll be prompted to fill out any required commit fields at commit time and your commit message will be formatted according to the standards defined by us.
